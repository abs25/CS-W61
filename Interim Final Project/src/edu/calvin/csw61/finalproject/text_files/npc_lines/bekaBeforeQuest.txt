“Hello, who might you be?”
“I'm Beka, your expert on international trade and large programs,” she replies. “Can I help you?”
“Yes,” you say. “I need to find out about Dutchmen.”
She recoils heavily and gives you a startled look. “Whatever for?”
“Uh, I ah, I'm writing a book about them,” you stammer.
“We're not allowed to talk much about them,” she tells you. “But over in the foreign language department, there is someone who might be able to help. You'll know her because she always has her nose in her Latin books.”
“By the way,” Beka continues, “I left my ID card up that way. If you see it, could you bring it back for me?”
“Sure!” you reply.
