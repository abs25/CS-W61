You decide to start things a little differently. “What's your name?” you ask.
“I'm Tyler,” he responds. He seems too sleepy to say anything else.
You decide to ask if everything is okay.
“I'm fine,” Tyler says. “I'm just worried about my animals. They seem to have gone cannibalistic. Some of them even eat themselves!”
“Oh dear,” you respond, somewhat apprehensively. “I hope you figure out the problem.”
“Thank you.” Tyler turns away. Suddenly, he looks back at you. “By the way, you're a pretty obvious Dutchman. You should probably watch that accent around here.”
You have an accent? You hadn't noticed. “Thanks.”
