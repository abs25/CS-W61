Peter shouts exictedly. “Have you heard? The most important person on campus is dining with us today!”
“And who might that be?” you ask.
“Our King and Ruler, the leader of the Leroykins, President LeRoy himself!”
Maybe he can help you figure things out, you think. “Where can I see him?”
“He's over in the room to the southwest. The one with the beard,” Peter tells you.
You begin to head that way.
“Wait!” Peter yells after you. “I lost my Raspberry Pi. Could you try to find it for me?"
"Couldn't you just get another pie? This is a dining hall after all," you respond.
"No no no no," Peter tells you. "A Raspberry Pi is small computer. Not food."
“Oh. Alright,” you tell him, “but it had better be an important pie.”
