"Hello," he says, "I'm Pastor Paul. Who might you be?"
"Well, I, uh, I'm not really sure," you sheepishly reply. "I don't really know how I got here. But this lady named Pastor Mary sent me here to look for her Bible. Have you seen it?"
He thinks for a moment before replying. "I haven't seen it, but it might be in her office on the western side of the building. When we were overrun by monsters, we all ran out immediately. She probably left it there in all the commotion. The only reason I'm still in here is because the demons trapped me in."
"Thank you," you reply. "By the way, I just defeated the demon."
"Really?" he looks at you incredulously. "Thank you! I'll leave just as soon as I can collect my things."
