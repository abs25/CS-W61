“I hear you're the one in charge around here?” you ask, somewhat accusingly.
“I guess you could say that, yes,” the President answers.
“Maybe you could tell me what in Knightdale is going on?” You are impatient, and want a straight answer.
“I've been waiting for you,” LeRoy says. “You see, there is a prophesy, made by the great John Calvin himself. This prophesy states that one day, Knightdale will fall into despair. As you've seen, I believe that has already happened. The previous president left us in this state. Something about a new arena. Anyway, when they built it, they uncovered some virus, and it produced the monsters you see.
“And large monsters they are,” you add.
“Definitely. The prophesy also says that only one can save us. And that one...” LeRoy hesitates, as if reluctant to finish.
“Go on,” you prod.
“That one,” he continues slowly, “must be a Dutchman. It has been predestined. As the prophesy states, 'From the land of No Hope will come the Hope for all of Knightdale.'”
“And you think I'm the one. But why me?”
“No reason,” the President tells you, “I've been sending my Leroykins to take every Dutchman that looks promising. You're the sixth or seventh.”
“So you just abducted me in hopes that I might be the one?” You are incensed and angrily storm out.
