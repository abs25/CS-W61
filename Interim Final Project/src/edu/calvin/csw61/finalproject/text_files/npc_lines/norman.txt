"Hi! I'm Professor Norman, but some people call me Vic Todd Norm."
"Can I just go with Vic?" you ask.
"Sure," he says. "Hey, see that door to the west? That's important. Remember that. I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I know you're going to need it."
"Really?" Why would you need a door? "Thanks."
"You're welcome. Oh, by the way," he reaches for your hand. "Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
