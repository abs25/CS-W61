You have never seen a ghost before, but you know instantly that this is what one looks like. Except it has a long beard. You wouldn't have expected that.
He starts to talk in a deep voice. "Welcome, Dutchman. Your time has come."
"My time? What does that mean?" you ask.
"You have completed your destiny. No one has been in here for hundreds of years. But now that you are here, I have been freed."
"That's... good?"
"Very good. But look at yourself. You are no longer who you used to be. During your time here, you have slowly become like us."
It is true. You are no longer the Dutchman you once were.
The ghost continues. "I am the ghost of John Calvin. I am the one who prophesied long ago that you would save us. Because you have freed me, I can wipe out the debt we owe and destroy the monsters. Thank you. All of Knightdale thanks you."
He bows and with a whoosh, leaves the room. You decide to take some time to contemplate all that has happened.
