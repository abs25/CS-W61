"Hi! I'm Pat Bailey. How can I help you?"
"Could you tell me who I am?" you ask him.
"Definitely. You come from Dutchland," he starts.
"Thanks, I knew that."
"Hold on, I'm not finished," he tells you. "When you were born, you were predestined to save us. Your previous life does not matter. It no longer exists. To save us, you will become one of us."
"Oh, okay." You sound apathetic, yet you are fully confused. Better keep moving.
