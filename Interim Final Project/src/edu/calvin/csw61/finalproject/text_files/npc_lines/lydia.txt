"You're welcome? I mean, you did kind of just pluck me out of my life... which, by the way, I know nothing about." You're still upset about what LeRoy told you.
"True," she says. "There are people here who can probably help you out on that. We Computer Science people are helpful AND smart."
"Really?" you'd like to meet these people. "Thanks!"
