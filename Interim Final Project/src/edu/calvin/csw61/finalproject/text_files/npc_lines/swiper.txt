"May I see your card please?" she asks.
"Um, I don't have a card. But there's no one here, why should I need it?"
"I need your card," she says grumpily.
"Can I just give you my number?"
"NO! I need your card."
You sigh. She seems unaware of the destruction around her. You try walking past her. She seems not to care. She must be really out of it. Whatever. You move on.
