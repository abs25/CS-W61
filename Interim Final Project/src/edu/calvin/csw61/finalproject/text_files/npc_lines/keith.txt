“Hello Grasshopper. What have you learned from your stay here?”
Grasshopper? Does he think you’re a student? “Honestly, I have learned almost nothing yet. Only a tiny bit about Dutchmen.”
“Dutchmen!” he scowls. “Those totally depraved mess of people? Let me tell you, when it comes to depravity, they’re the worst of the bunch.”
“Why are they so bad?” you ask.
“You mean you don’t know?” He is surprised. “I guess it was inevitable. They were predestined to believe that they weren’t destined to be predestined. However, they were destined to depravity.”
“I will ponder this,” you tell him.
“Good,” he says, and turns back to his food.
