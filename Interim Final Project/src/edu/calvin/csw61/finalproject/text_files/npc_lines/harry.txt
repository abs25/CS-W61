"Hello. I'm Professor Plantinga."
"Could you tell me a bit about my past?" you ask.
"How would I know about that?" he responds.
"Just a shot in the dark," you answer. "It's alright."
He thinks for a second and then starts to talk. "Well, you're a Dutchman."
"Yes, I knew that," you say.
"And you're here to help us. We took you from the land of no hope and brought you here in hope that you might save us."
"I knew that to," you say under your breath. Maybe you should find somebody more helpful. "Thanks for your help!"
