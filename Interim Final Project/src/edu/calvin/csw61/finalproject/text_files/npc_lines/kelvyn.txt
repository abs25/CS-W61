"Hi! I'm Kelvyn, and we," Kelvyn gestures to a few people around him, "are the WA's."
“What's a WA?” you ask.
“Worship Apprentice,” Kelvyn responds. “We're responsible for Chapel services and building maintenance. What's your name?”
Faced with the question again, you decide to tell them the whole story. They nod knowingly, and Kelvyn speaks up again.
“We know who you are, and we're sorry. So sorry. But there's nothing we can do about it. You were destined for this life from the beginning of time.”
“What?” you wonder. “What is this place?”
A demon roars in the distance and the WA's scatter. You are left on your own.
