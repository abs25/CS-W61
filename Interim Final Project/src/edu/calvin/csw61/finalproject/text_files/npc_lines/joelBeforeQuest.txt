"Hello Dutchman. I know what you're here for. Before you can complete your mission, you will need prove your worth to us."
"How do I do that?" you ask. "And why should I even want to help you? You did kidnap me, after all."
"See that tulip growing over there? It represents you. And because of your total depravity, you will persist in helping us. You were unconditionally elected to do this, and by grace it is irresistible for you. By helping us, you will earn limited atonement for your depravity."
"Uh... huh..." You're not quite sure what all that means, but it sounds highly theological. Maybe it's just a coincidence. "So what do I need to do?"
"I need you to find the coveted statue of Moses and bring it back to me. The Computer Scientists will reign above all on Chaos Day!"
"Okay," you say. He sounds a little power hungry. But you can't stop yourself. You must go find Moses.
