"Where am I?" you say to yourself. The world is spinning around your head. You attempt to sit up and look around, but you're so dizzy and sore that you fall back down. "Ugh," you moan.
Slowly, your vision starts to clear. Gingerly, you lift yourself up into a sitting position. The world is spinning more slowly now, and you see that you are in the middle of a large, grassy lawn.
"What happened?" you wonder. Suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, you realize that you have forgotten the last few years of your previous life. This realization knocks you back onto the ground.
"I'm doomed," you think. "what do I do now?" You sit up again and take a look around you. There are four buildings within walking distance, one in each direction. Out of the corner of your eye you see something moving.
Looking closer, you see that a woman is walking towards you. She has a smile on her face and looks friendly. As she reaches you, she starts to speak.
"Hello there!" she says. "Welcome to Knightdale! I'm Pastor Mary."
She seems friendly enough. Why not talk to her more and try to find out where you are?
